Abstract
The valuation of used vehicles is a difficult economic challenge that is influenced by non-linear depreciation patterns and diverse market factors.  This study addresses this limitation by performing a comparative regression analysis to predict resale prices using two popular ensemble learning algorithms: Random Forest and Gradient Boosting.  Using a dataset of 30,000 records from the UK used car market, the study employs a structured data science pipeline that includes rigorous preprocessing and feature engineering.  The predictive abilities of both models are assessed using the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and R-squared metrics.  Gradient Boosting outperformed Random Forest on this dataset, with a R² of 0.73 vs. 0.70.Furthermore, feature importance analysis reveals that mileage and horsepower are the most important determinants of resale value, providing valuable insights for market stakeholders.
